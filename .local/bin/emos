prompts="If you let someone else control your mind, isn't it ultimate slavery?
Don't adore those who ignore you. Don't ignore those who adore you. 
If you can't fly, run. If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk, crawl. But by all means keep moving.
If you want to make everyone happy, don't be a leader - sell ice cream.
When you're good at something, you will tell everybody. But when you are great, everybody will tell you.
Just because it hurts, it doesn't mean you gonna die.
When you're getting your shit together, it will get lonely. Choose growth over company, every single time. And always remember why you started.
The only guarantee of failure is to give up. The only guarantee to succeed is to keep trying."
