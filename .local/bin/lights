# Change rgb lights on my PC
# (DISCLAIMER) OpenRGB is very very
# buggy when used on commandline, let
# alone in scripts. If your lights get
# bricked, just run this script in a
# loop, and it should (hopefully)
# start working again.
# Dependencies:
#	- openrgb
#	- Execute `openrgb` with sudo privileges without password.
